Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Output:
2
Explanation:
2 is represented as "10" in Binary.
As we see there's only one set bit
and it's in Position 2 and thus the
Output 2.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
-1
Explanation:
5 is represented as "101" in Binary.
As we see there's two set bits
and thus the Output -1.
