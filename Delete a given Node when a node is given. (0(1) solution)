Example 1:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 2:
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4], node = 3
Output: [1,2,4]

Example 4:
Input: head = [0,1], node = 0
Output: [1]

Example 5:
Input: head = [-3,5,-99], node = -3
Output: [5,-99]
